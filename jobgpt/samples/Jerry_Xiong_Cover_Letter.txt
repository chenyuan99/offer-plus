Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer position at LinkedIn, as advertised. With a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering from New York University, a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from Michigan State University, and a robust background in software development, data analysis, and machine learning, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to LinkedIn's mission to connect the world's professionals.

In my current role at SOJO, I have honed my skills in developing innovative solutions for the healthcare industry. I have led the development of a "Music Therapy Platform," where I was responsible for algorithm development, data analysis, and web application implementation using Django. My work involved processing bioelectrical signals, applying deep learning techniques, and ensuring system security, resulting in a 10% improvement in overall application efficiency and 100% error-free performance.

During my tenure as a Graduate Research Assistant at New York University, I led projects that leveraged DSP, neural networks, and machine learning to analyze bioelectrical signals and generate AI-driven music compositions. This experience equipped me with the technical acumen and problem-solving abilities essential for developing scalable and high-performance applications.

At Michigan State University, I served as a Research Assistant, where I supported students with data analysis, statistical modeling, and thesis proofreading. This role enhanced my collaboration and communication skills, which are crucial for working effectively within a team.

I am particularly drawn to LinkedIn's innovative culture and commitment to professional growth. I am eager to bring my technical expertise, passion for continuous learning, and collaborative spirit to your esteemed team. I am confident that my background and skills align well with the requirements of the Software Engineer position and that I can make a meaningful contribution to LinkedIn’s ongoing success.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience and skills can contribute to the innovative projects at LinkedIn. Please feel free to contact me at [Your Email] or [Your Phone Number] to schedule an interview.

Sincerely,

Jerry Xiong
